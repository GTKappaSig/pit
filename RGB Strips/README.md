## RGB Strip Controller
The pit will have "[ESP8266 NodeMCU LUA CH340 ESP-12E WiFi Internet Development Board](https://www.amazon.com/ESP8266-Internet-Development-Wireless-Micropython/dp/B07RNX3W9J/ref=sr_1_5?)"s to control all of the RGB Strips. Currently we have a generic white box, an arduino, and a music sensitive box controlling our current strips. The ESP8266 Controller is programmable and can be controlled over wifi which blows all of our current options out of the water.
